- Initialized environment and scripts in `scripts/` (`prep_receptor.sh`, `prep_ligands.py`, `dock.sh`, `rmsd_check.py`, `collect_results.py`).
- Prepared MAO-B receptor (2V5Z Chain A) with FAD cofactor using `scripts/prep_receptor.sh`.
- Extracted and prepared native safinamide ligand (SAG) with `scripts/prep_ligands.py`.
- Executed calibration redocking with `scripts/dock.sh 2V5Z native_SAG 11` (exhaustiveness=32, seed=11).
- Computed symmetry-corrected RMSD with `scripts/rmsd_check.py`:
  - Pose 1 RMSD: 1.38 Å
  - Pose 3 (best) RMSD: 0.56 Å -> **PASS** (< 2.0 Å threshold).
- **GATE 0 (Calibration exercise) passed.**

- Initialized environment and scripts in `scripts/` (`prep_receptor.sh`, `prep_ligands.py`, `dock.sh`, `rmsd_check.py`, `collect_results.py`).
- Prepared MAO-B receptor (2V5Z Chain A) with FAD cofactor using `scripts/prep_receptor.sh`.
- Extracted and prepared native safinamide ligand (SAG) with `scripts/prep_ligands.py`.
- Executed calibration redocking with `scripts/dock.sh 2V5Z native_SAG 11` (exhaustiveness=32, seed=11).
- Computed symmetry-corrected RMSD with `scripts/rmsd_check.py`:
  - Pose 1 RMSD: 1.38 Å
  - Pose 3 (best) RMSD: 0.56 Å -> **PASS** (< 2.0 Å threshold).
- **GATE 0 (Calibration exercise) passed.**

## 2026-08-20 — A

Day 1 environment setup (§Part 2, Day 1).

**Native Windows, conda env `docking_project`:** was rdkit-only at start. Installed
`openmm mdanalysis prolif parmed` via conda-forge, and `spyrmsd meeko dimorphite-dl`
via pip. `python -m openmm.testInstallation` confirms a working CUDA platform
(RTX 4050, driver CUDA UMD 13.3) — MD runs (§A6–A8) can run natively, no WSL needed
for the simulation itself.

**AmberTools has no Windows build** (confirmed: zero conda-forge win-64 matches for
`ambertools`). This blocks `acpype` and `MMPBSA.py` natively. Machine already had
WSL2 Ubuntu with GPU passthrough working (`nvidia-smi` visible inside WSL). Installed
Miniconda in WSL2 and created a minimal env `mdgbsa` (`ambertools acpype`, conda-forge
only — had to use `--override-channels` to skip the `defaults` channel's ToS gate).
Both `acpype` (v2023.10.27) and `MMPBSA.py` (v14.0) confirmed callable inside WSL.

**Net environment split for Machine A:**
- Native Windows `docking_project`: rdkit, openmm(CUDA), MDAnalysis, prolif, parmed,
  spyrmsd, meeko, dimorphite-dl, vina, obabel — docking + MD + analysis.
- WSL2 `mdgbsa`: acpype (GAFF2 parameterization), MMPBSA.py (MM-GBSA) only — used
  because AmberTools has no Windows port, not a general duplicate stack.

**NOTE:** meeko's CLI installs as `mk_prepare_receptor.exe` / `mk_prepare_ligand.exe`
on Windows, not `mk_prepare_receptor.py` as written in the doc's Part 6 scripts. Both
`mk_prepare_receptor` (no extension) and the `.exe` form work from bash. Scripts in
`scripts/` need this accounted for per machine, per the doc's own warning about
Meeko's CLI changing across versions.

**STILL OPEN:** the lead compound's acpype/GAFF2 parameter files (named as one of the
three Day-1-critical files) were not found anywhere in the recovered `artifacts/` —
no `.itp`/`.top`/`.frcmod`/`.mol2`. Will need to be regenerated via `acpype` (WSL)
before Week 2's MD system builds (§A6), which assume these already exist and are
just reused across all four systems.

Files: none yet (environment-only session, no data outputs).
